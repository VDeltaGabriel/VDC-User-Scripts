# VDC-User-Scripts
Automatically loads user scripts on Valve Developer Community.
## How it works?
It is very simple! It loads the script file from ```User:[USERNAME]/common.js``` by adding it as a script tag on the page.
## Warning
Be careful! Although the scripts are on the VDC site it does not mean they cannot contain malicious code! Whenever you enter a user page you will be prompted with confirmation whether you want to load custom user script.
